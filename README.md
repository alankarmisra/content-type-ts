# Create and parse HTTP Content-Type header according to RFC 7231

This library is under-construction. It is heavily inspired by the node [content-type](https://github.com/jshttp/content-type) library though I prefer writing in TS and this library resonates that. I'm building an expressjs clone (in TS) with minimal reliance on core external libraries so I may learn. While I have every intention of building this library for quality and compactness, if you want a supported library, please look at content-type. 

More updates to come.
